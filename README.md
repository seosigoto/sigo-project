## What is Wevest?

The wevest protocol is an innovative lending protocol that can return profits to both borrowers and lenders by utilizing 'the Use Right Delegated Interest Rate Structure'. The wevest protocol is a 100% DAO operated by smart contracts, and all processes such as loans, repayments, and risk management are processed without human intervention.

The wevest protocol has the functions to implement a loan with three characteristics: 1) interest free, 2) no maturity, and 3) leverage, and its structure is different from the general lending protocol. The biggest difference in terms of technology can be summarized in three ways: interest rate model, liquidity pool management, and risk management.
